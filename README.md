Data Analysis for "Lucky Goals and Outcome Bias: Natural Experiment Using Spatial Discontinuity Around the Goal Frame"

Abstract: In this project, I use geocoded soccer data (StatsBomb) and take advantage of the spatial discontinuity around the goal frame in a Regression Discontinuity Design to estimate the causal effects of luck on evaluation of soccer players. Intuitively, the identifying assumption is that conditional on shooting close to the goal frame (i.e., hitting the post), the shot quasi-randomly ends up as a score or a miss. Thus, any consequenctial difference in the evaluatiosn of the player reflects the extent to which they capture randomness. This points to an exploitable market bias where unlucky (lucky) players are undervalued (overvalued).
